          <h4>Software Engine Optimization</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers.SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search,news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. SEO differs from local search engine optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products or services. The former instead is more focused on national searches.</p>

          <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4"> 1. Previewing pages
 
Notice that when you use your mouse to point at a particular search result, called aresult block, a small, sideways chevron appears next to it (). Clicking on that chevron allows you to preview a document, letting you determine what kind of document is behind the link. It can help you decide whether that link meets your needs, and whether you want to visit the page.
These previews, in combination with skimming results, can help you get a quick grounding in a subject.
 
2. Understanding an individual search result
 
Result blocks on a search results page consist of three major elements:
 
Title: The blue link in the top line gives you the topic of the page.
 
Web address/URL: The second line contains a green link which tells you location of the document on the web. This line can help you determine the source of the information.
 
Snippet: This last two lines, the black text, show you some of the places where your search terms appear on the page, embedded in the text in which they appear. A snippet is not a complete summary of the text on a page; it is only search terms in context, extracted from the document.
 
Ellipses: In some snippets you see an ellipsis (...). Be careful about how you interpret the ellipsis. Text that is taken out and replaced by the ellipses could be critical to answering your question.
 
3. Using an entire results page
 
Not only is it helpful to know how to understand a single result, but you can gain a lot from taking a moment to look over an entire screen or page full of results.</p>

<h5 class="white-text"><HEAD>How SEO affects business?</HEAD></h5>
<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4"> Increase your website's visibility on search engines like Google and Bing and attract the right kind of traffic to the right pages on your site. Learn about search engine optimization including how to read a results page, find your ranking, and see how rankings affect businesses large and small.</p>
       
<h5 class="white-text"><HEAD>List Some Important SEO expectations</HEAD></h5>
<p class="grey-text text-lighten-4"> Knowing only a few pages or posts on your site might ever rank well.

The importance of backlinks can’t be stressed enough. Focus as much of your time as possible on the promotion of your content. It’s common for a large proportion of your overall organic search traffic to come from a very small proportion of your overall content. Without doubt, the biggest cause of failure with SEO campaigns is the assumption that simply creating great content will get you results.

*Failing to adjust.

Once upon a time, your first shot at SEO may have yielded solid results. Now, making a serious and strategic attempt at SEO is the starting point. I see this situation frequently, for example: if you’re not ranking for that perfect keyword yet, go after a new one. Don’t lose sight of those great keywords, but don’t sit around thinking your site will magically start ranking for it if it hasn’t yet. You have to pursue, in the meanwhile, related additional longer-tail, less competitive phrases, which help you gain ground in tackling higher trafficked terms.

*SEO is more than just plugging holes.

This is not as easy as plugging holes. It is more than that.SEO just takes more things coming together. You have to identify, and work the opportunities, as much as you have to plug holes.

*The magic is in the maintenance.

It is rarely the one-time work that will meet your goals and expectations. When you lay the SEO foundation on your website—selecting keywords, undergoing the rigorous, yet important minutiae of on-page optimization, redirecting and site speed and other technical obstacles—that used to be all it took. Today, it is the starting point.

*Reality checking your budget.

do you have the time and money to invest? It will require a mix of both. And when I say “both” I mean “both.” You cannot get results by throwing money at the problem. SEO, especially initially, requires an investment of dollars and a mix of people of strategists, tactical doers, and purse-string holders.</p>
